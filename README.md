# Arduino_Project

The projects that are within this repository are small scale projects that I am working on to accomplish two things. The first is to learn more about embedded programming with microcontrollers. The second is to take a deeper dive into the basics of electronics. My goal with these projects is to possibly convert my development skills into robotics. The sourcecode is overly verbose for not just thoes who may want to utilize some of these projects behind me but to also to keep as a referrence as I continue to educate my self as an aspiring Software Enigneer.
