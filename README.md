# Arduino_Project

The projects that are within this repository are small scale projects that I am working on to accomplish two things. The first is to learn more about embedded programming and the basics of eletronics. The second is to learn more about Mechanical Engineering. The goal of these projects is to take my programming skills into robotics for a new hobby.
